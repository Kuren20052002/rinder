# Random Image Generator

A simple Ruby on Rails application that uses the Unsplash API to fetch and display random images or search for images based on a keyword. This project demonstrates how to integrate an external API (Unsplash) into a Rails application, handle API requests, and display dynamic content in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Fetches random images from the Unsplash API
- Allows searching for images based on a keyword (e.g., "cats", "nature", "city")
- Displays images in a responsive layout
- Configured to store API keys securely using Rails credentials
